# A convolutional network in PyTorch to recognize handwritten digits as given in the MNIST dataset

[Description of the dataset we will be working with](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database)

## Using GPU

One advantage of using pytorch as a framework is that it allows us to execute our code on the GPU. This can often greatly reduce the runtime needed to train neural networks. Below is a short description of how to do this.
